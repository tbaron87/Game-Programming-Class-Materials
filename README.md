# Game-Programming-Class-Materials

This is the repository of all Unity code and scene examples used in the SER 494/594 Game Programming and Design class.

## This project has been updated for Unity version 2022.3.6f1

Unity is explicitly NOT backwards compatable so these examples will not be expected to work in previous versions of Unity. While it should work in the above version without any issue, you should be able to update it to any later version with only minor deprecation warnings. This project will be updated to the latest version every time this course is run. 

## Project Structure

The intention is for you to download the entire Unity porject as one whole set of examples. At the top level of the project is a set of folders, one for each module in the course. All of these folders are treated as their own self contained projects. So, each has all the related scripts in it and an example scene that has those scripts and such being used.
